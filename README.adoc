Got it running on <<heroku-deployment>> as of April 2021 at https://cirosantilli-realworld-express.herokuapp.com/

Includes a working single-process fullstack <<heroku-deployment>> by building the https://github.com/gothinkster/react-redux-realworld-example-app frontend statically and serving it from the public folder of the backend.

CSS bundling to use https://demo.productionready.io/main.css from the SCSS source is also setup, but blocked on: https://github.com/gothinkster/conduit-bootstrap-template/issues/5#issuecomment-829104220

This started as a fork of: https://github.com/sigoden/node-express-realworld-example-app (deleted on 2021-06-21 probably because of fear of backslash from the Chinese communist party after Ciro created some issues there) which was likely a port of https://github.com/gothinkster/node-express-realworld-example-app both of which are backend implementations of the awesome https://github.com/gothinkster/realworld sigoden was a good starting point, but it notably did not implement any of the many-to-many relations properly in SQL, rather hacking it with strings. We have now implemented those properly with relations (and it was not a breeze partly because sequelize is so quirky).

The `react-redux-realworld-example-app` is stored at link:react-redux-realworld-example-app[] as a submodule, and some small modifications have been made to it from the upstream, they are tracked at: https://github.com/cirosantilli/react-redux-realworld-example-app

Website behaviour is intended to match the front and backend upstreams as closely as possible, minus except possible obvious bugs.

Other versions of this repository include:

* Next.js instead of React + Redux: https://github.com/cirosantilli/node-express-sequelize-nextjs-realworld-example-app

Tested on an Ubuntu 21.04 development host.

== Local development with SQLite

.....
npm install
npm run dev
.....

The browser automatically pops the development front-end server at http://localhost:4101[] which makes requests to the backend server that runs at http://localhost:3000[].

You might also want to generate some test data as mentioned at: <<generate-demo-data>>.

The SQLite database is located at `db.sqlite3`.

== Local optimized frontend

.....
npm install
npm run build
npm start
.....

The website can now be seen at: http://localhost:3000

This setup does not start the front-end development server at http://localhost:4101[], but rather compiles the front-end files statically, and serves them on the public folder of the backend server, giving performance representative performance characteristics of the frontend.

This setup is much closer to the final type of setup that will run in production, and it runs a single server.

Running it locally might help debug some front-end deployment issues.

But otherwise you will just normally use the <<local-run-as-identical-to-deployment-as-possible>> setup instead for development, because this setup lacks important debug features such as:

* hot code reloading

This setup still runs on `NODE_ENV=development`, which implies that sqlite is used, so no further database setup is needed for PostgreSQL. This also means however that you might experience different performance characteristics or behaviour not ironed out by Sequelize between SQLite vs PotsgreSQL.

=== Local run as identical to deployment as possible

Here we use PostgreSQL instead of SQLite with the prebuilt static frontend. Note that optimized frontend is also used on the SQLite setup described at <<local-optimized-frontend>>).

For when you really need to debug some deployment stuff locally

Setup:

....
sudo apt install postgresql

# Become able to run psql command without sudo.
sudo -u postgres createuser -s "$(whoami)"
createdb "$(whoami)"

createdb node_express_sequelize_realworld
psql -c "CREATE ROLE node_express_sequelize_realworld_user with login password 'a'"
psql -c 'GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON DATABASE node_express_sequelize_realworld TO node_express_sequelize_realworld_user'
echo "SECRET=$(tr -dc A-Za-z0-9 </dev/urandom | head -c 256)" >> .env
....

Run:

....
npm run build
npm run start-prod
....

then visit the running website at: http://localhost:3000/

To <<generate-demo-data>> for this instance run:

....
NODE_ENV=production DATABASE_URL='postgres://node_express_sequelize_realworld_user:a@localhost:5432/node_express_sequelize_realworld' ./bin/generate-demo-data.js --force-production
....

== Local run as identical to deployment as possible

First setup the database as described at: https://github.com/cirosantilli/node-express-sequelize-realworld-example-app#local-run-as-identical-to-deployment-as-possible

Then run with:

....
npm run build-dev
npm run start-prod
....

== Heroku deployment

First time setup:

....
heroku git:remote -a cirosantilli-realworld-express
# Automatically sets DATABASE_URL.
heroku addons:create heroku-postgresql:hobby-dev
# Otherwise the react build picks up the .eslint from this directory,
# which specifies a plugin that is not installed because it is in the
# devDependencies of this package.json... For the love of God, this is
# a deployment, not a CI.
# https://stackoverflow.com/questions/55821078/disable-eslint-that-create-react-app-provides
heroku config:set DISABLE_ESLINT_PLUGIN=true
# Notably to skip ultra-slow sqlite native build.
heroku config:set NPM_CONFIG_PRODUCTION=true YARN_PRODUCTION=true
heroku config:set SECRET="$(tr -dc A-Za-z0-9 </dev/urandom | head -c 256)"
# Optional. If set, enables demo mode.
heroku config:set CIROSANTILLI_DEMO=true
....

Every update:

....
npm run deploy
....

=== Demo mode

If `CIROSANTILLI_DEMO=true` is set, then the app runs in demo mode.

You can also run this mode with:

....
npm run dev-demo
....


This has the following effects:

* block posts with tags given at `blacklistTags` of `config.js` The initial motivation for this was to block automated "Cypress Automation" spam that is likely setup by some bastard on all published implementations via the backend, example: https://archive.ph/wip/n4Jlx[], and might be taking up a good part of our Heroku dynos, to be confirmed.
+
We've logged their IP as 31.183.168.37, let's see if it changes with time. That IP is from Poland, which is consistent with Google Analytics results, which are overwhelmingly from Poland, suggesting a bot within that country, which also does GET on the web UI.
* whenever a new object is created, such as article, comment or user, if we already have 1000 objects of that type, delete the oldest object of that type, so as to keep the database size limited

=== Heroku instance management

Get a PostgreSQL shell:

....
heroku psql
....

DELETE ALL DATA IN THE DATABASE and <<generate-demo-data>> inside Heroku:

....
heroku run bash
....

and then run in that shell:

....
bin/generate-demo-data.js --force-production
....

or you can do it in one go with:

....
heroku run bin/generate-demo-data.js --force-production
....

We have to run `heroku run bash` instead of `heroku ps:exec` because the second command does not set `DATABASE_URL`:

* https://stackoverflow.com/questions/62502951/heroku-env-variables-database-url-and-port-not-showing-in-dyno-heroku-psexec/68050303#68050303
* https://stackoverflow.com/questions/48119289/how-to-get-environment-variables-in-live-heroku-dyno/64951959#64951959
* https://www.reddit.com/r/rails/comments/ejljxj/how_to_seed_a_postgres_production_database_on/

Edit a file in Heroku to debug that you are trying to run manually, e.g. by adding print commands, uses https://github.com/hakash/termit[] minimal https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_nano[nano]-like text editor:

....
heroku ps:exec
termit app.js
....

== Debugging

=== Step debugging

For the backend, add `debugger;` to the point of interest, and run as:

....
npm run back-inspect
....

On the debugger, do a `c` to continue so that the server will start running (impossible to skip automatically: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/16420374/how-to-disable-in-the-node-debugger-break-on-first-line[]), and then trigger your event of interest from the browser:

....
npm run front
....

=== VERBOSE environment variable

If you run as:

....
VERBOSE=1 npm run dev
....

this enables the following extra logs:

* a log line for every request done

=== Log database queries done

....
DEBUG='sequelize:sql:*' npm run start-prod
....

=== Generate demo data

Note that this will first erase any data present in the database:

....
./bin/generate-demo-data.js
....

You can then login with users such as:

* `user0@mail.com`
* `user1@mail.com`

and password `asdf`.

Test data size can be configured with CLI parameters, e.g.:

....
./bin/generate-demo-data.js --n-users 5 --n-articles-per-user 8 --n-follows-per-user 3
....

=== Prevent the browser from opening automatically

In case you've broken things so bad that the very first GET blows up the website and further requests don't respond https://stackoverflow.com/questions/61927814/how-to-disable-open-browser-in-cra

....
BROWSER=none npm run dev
....

This gives you time to setup e.g. Network recording in Chrome Developer Tools to be able to understand what is going on.

=== Sequelize sometimes does not show the full stack trace

This is a big problem during development, not sure how to solve it: https://github.com/sequelize/sequelize/issues/8199#issuecomment-863943835

== Testing

=== API tests

These tests are part of https://github.com/gothinkster/realworld which we track here as a submodule.

Test test method uses Postman, but we feel that it is not a very good way to do the testing, as it uses JSON formats everywhere with embedded JavaScript, presumably to be edited in some dedicated editor like Jupyter does. It would be much better to just have a pure JavaScript setup instead.

They test the JSON REST API without the frontend.

First start the backend server in a terminal:

....
npm run back-test
....

`npm run back-test` will make our server use a clean one-off in-memory database instead of using the default in-disk development `./db.sqlite3` as done for `npm run back`.

Then on another terminal:

....
npm run test-api
....

Run a single test called `Register` instead:

....
npm run test-api -- --folder Register
....

TODO: many tests depend on previous steps, notably register. But we weren't able to make it run just given specific tests e.g. with:

....
npmr test-api -- --folder 'Register' --folder 'Login and Remember Token' --folder 'Create Article'
....

only the last `--folder` is used. Some threads say that multiple ones can be used in newer Newman, but even after updating it to latest v5 we couldn't get it to work: 

* https://stackoverflow.com/questions/60057009/how-to-run-single-request-from-the-collection-in-newman
* https://stackoverflow.com/questions/52519415/how-to-read-two-folder-with-newman

=== Unit tests

Ideally, all tests should be API test, so that they will work across any backend implementation more easily, and test the system more fully.

However, setting up full API tests can be annoying, especially the user creation part, as especially since Postman is so clunky.

Furthermore, the API tests can have a slower setup time, since by going directly to the backend API we can call `bulkCreate` which can be much faster than creating objects one by one.

So sometimes, especially for things like model relations, we will just revert to a some quick direct database tests:

....
npm test
....

Run just a single test:

....
npm test -- -g 'substring of test title'
....

Show all queries done in the tests:

....
DEBUG='sequelize:sql:*' npm test
....

To run those tests on PostgreSQL intead, first setup as in <<local-run-as-identical-to-deployment-as-possible>>, and then 

....
NODE_ENV=production DATABASE_URL='postgres://node_express_sequelize_realworld_user:a@localhost:5432/node_express_sequelize_realworld' npm test
....

== Bugs

Major React Redux upstream bugs:

* https://github.com/gothinkster/react-redux-realworld-example-app/issues/197 Your Feed pagination is just completely broken. This is not an API bug in this repo.

Minor ones:

* https://github.com/gothinkster/react-redux-realworld-example-app/pull/183#issuecomment-868436798

== Database conventions

The naming conventions are meant to be similar to the JavaScript naming conventions:

* camel case on tables and columns
* tables start with a capital letter, because they are class-like
* columns start with a lowercase letter, because they are field-like
* tables use singular form

Achieving this requires fighting a bit with sequelize, which by default produces inconsistent names on foreign keys.

However I later learnt they did do/attempt to do the many to many relatioships properly unlike sigoden which just hacked with strings.
